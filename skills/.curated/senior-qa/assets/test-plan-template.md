# Test Plan (copy/paste)

Use this as a starting point and keep it short. Prefer checklists and concrete commands.

## Must-pass checks
- [ ] CI green (unit/integration)
- [ ] E2E smoke path
- [ ] No new high severity bugs

## Manual checklist
- [ ] Auth flow
- [ ] Primary CTA path
- [ ] Error states + empty states
- [ ] Accessibility: keyboard + focus visible + contrast
