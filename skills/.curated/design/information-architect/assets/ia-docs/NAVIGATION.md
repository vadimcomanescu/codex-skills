# Navigation Spec

Define rules, not just labels. The goal is predictability, not novelty.

## IA Thesis
[TODO]

## Organizing Principle
[TODO]

## Global Navigation
| Label | Destination | Who sees it | Why it’s top-level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] | [TODO] |

Notes:
- Target 5–7 global items unless evidence strongly suggests otherwise.
- Keep labels stable; move content under a label before changing the label.

## Local Navigation (within a section)
Choose the appropriate pattern per section:
- Tabs (3–7 peers)
- Side nav (10–20 peers)
- Stepper (linear workflows)

Document per section:
- Section:
  - Pattern:
  - Items:
  - Rationale:

## Contextual Navigation (inside an object/workflow)
- Where actions live (primary vs overflow):
- Related views (history, activity, settings):
- Cross-links (related objects):

## Wayfinding
- Page titles match nav labels:
- Breadcrumbs (where used):
- Active states:
- “Back to list” behavior:

## Permissions and Roles
- Roles:
- What changes in nav for each role:
- Empty/denied states copy:

## URL / Route Conventions (web)
- Nouns for objects, verbs for actions.
- Stable IDs vs slugs rules.
- Redirect strategy for moved routes.
