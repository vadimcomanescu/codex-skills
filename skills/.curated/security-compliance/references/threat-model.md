# Threat Model (lightweight template)

## System
- What is the feature/system?
- Primary actors (users, admins, services)
- Trust boundaries and data flows

## Assets
- What must be protected? (credentials, PII, money movement, admin powers)

## Top abuse cases (start with 5)
For each:
- Attack: what could go wrong?
- Impact: what happens if it succeeds?
- Likelihood: low/med/high (justify briefly)
- Mitigations: controls + detection + recovery

## Residual risk
What remains? What do we accept vs fix before launch?
