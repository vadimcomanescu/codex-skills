# Next.js App Router Starter

Copy these files into an existing Next.js App Router project to bootstrap a strongly-themed, token-driven page.

- Files assume `app/` routing (not `pages/`).
- Uses CSS variables + CSS Modules (no external styling dependencies).
- Designed to be rethemed by editing `app/globals.css` tokens.
