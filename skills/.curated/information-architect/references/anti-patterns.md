# IA Anti-Patterns (delete these)

## Structure
- **Too many top-level items**: everything is “important” so nothing is.
- **Mixed principles**: task buckets next to audience buckets next to random nouns.
- **Deep nesting**: users must click 4+ levels deep to reach common destinations.
- **“Misc/Other/Tools” dumping grounds**: a permanent junk drawer that grows forever.
- **Duplicate pathways** without clear intent: the same page is reachable in 3 places with 3 different labels.

## Labels
- **Internal taxonomy leakage**: labels mirror teams/org structure, not user language.
- **Near-synonyms**: “Billing” vs “Payments” vs “Invoices” scattered across UI.
- **Generic labels**: “Manage”, “Tools”, “Dashboard” without specificity.

## Wayfinding
- **No “you are here”**: missing active states, unclear page titles, inconsistent breadcrumbs.
- **Action confusion**: global nav contains actions that should be buttons or contextual tools.

## Governance
- **Tag sprawl**: anyone can create tags; no merge/rename policy.
- **Permission surprises**: nav shows places users can’t access, or hides too much without explanation.

## Process
- **Designing by org politics**: categories reflect internal ownership, not user jobs.
- **Skipping validation**: shipping a new IA without at least one findability check.
