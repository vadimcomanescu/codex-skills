# Curated Skills

Skills in this folder are intended to be stable and broadly useful. Skills are grouped by category, e.g. `skills/.curated/<category>/<skill-name>/`.

Before promoting a skill here, ensure:

- Clear, reproducible instructions in `SKILL.md`
- No repo-specific assumptions unless documented
- Bundled assets work out-of-the-box (or have explicit prerequisites)
