# Git Commit Helper

Create concise, high-signal commits that explain intent and scope.

## Quick Start
1) Summarize the change and split unrelated edits.
2) Choose a conventional commit prefix if applicable.
3) Write a short subject + optional body describing why.

## Guardrails
- One logical change per commit.
- Avoid noisy “WIP” messages unless asked.
- Mention user-visible impact when relevant.

## References
- Extended examples: `references/examples.md`
