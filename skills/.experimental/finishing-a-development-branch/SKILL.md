# Finishing a Development Branch

Prepare a branch for review or merge with a clean, verified state.

## Quick Start
1) Sync with the target base branch.
2) Run relevant tests and linters.
3) Review diff for scope creep or leftovers.
4) Update docs or release notes if needed.

## Guardrails
- Don’t merge without tests or explicit approval.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in the same PR.

## References
- Extended examples: `references/examples.md`
