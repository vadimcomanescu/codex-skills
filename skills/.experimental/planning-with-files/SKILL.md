# Planning with Files

Use persistent markdown files as working memory for complex tasks.

## Quick Start
1) Create `task_plan.md` before starting.
2) Capture research in `notes.md`.
3) Write the final output in a deliverable file.
4) Update `task_plan.md` after each phase.

## Guardrails
- Don’t start complex work without a plan file.
- Store large findings in files, not chat context.
- Keep status and errors in `task_plan.md`.
