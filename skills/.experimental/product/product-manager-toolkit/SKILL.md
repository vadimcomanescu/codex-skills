# Product Manager Toolkit

Practical workflows for prioritization, discovery synthesis, and PRD creation.

## Quick Start
- **RICE prioritization**: `scripts/rice_prioritizer.py` (CSV in, ranked list out)
- **Interview analysis**: `scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py` (transcript in, insights out)
- **PRD templates**: start from `references/prd_templates.md`

## Core Workflows
1) **Prioritize**: collect requests → score with RICE → validate capacity.
2) **Discover**: run interviews → synthesize themes → map to opportunities.
3) **Specify**: choose PRD template → define scope, metrics, acceptance criteria.

## Guardrails
- Always define non-goals.
- Keep metrics measurable and time-bound.
- Separate discovery notes from decisions.
