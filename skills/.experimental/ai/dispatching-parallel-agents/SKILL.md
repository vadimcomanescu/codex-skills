# Dispatching Parallel Agents

Break large tasks into parallel units with clear boundaries and merge outputs safely.

## Quick Start
1) Split the goal into independent tasks.
2) Assign each agent a clear scope and output format.
3) Merge results and resolve conflicts.

## Guardrails
- Avoid overlapping scopes to reduce conflicting edits.
- Require each agent to state assumptions and sources.
- Consolidate into a single coherent output before shipping.
