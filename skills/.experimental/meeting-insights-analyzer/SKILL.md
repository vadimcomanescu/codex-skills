# Meeting Insights Analyzer

Turn transcripts into concrete, actionable communication feedback.

## Quick Start
1) Confirm scope (which meetings, time range, goal).
2) Summarize patterns and provide timestamped examples.
3) Offer 2–3 improvement actions with measurable goals.

## Analysis Focus Areas
- Speaking ratio and turn-taking
- Clarity vs. hedging/filler words
- Conflict avoidance or indirect feedback
- Active listening signals (summaries, questions)
- Facilitation behaviors (agenda control, decisions)

## Output Format
- **Summary**: 3–5 key patterns
- **Examples**: timestamped quotes for each pattern
- **Action plan**: 2–3 targeted improvements
- **Trends** (if multiple meetings): what changed over time

## Guardrails
- Ask permission before analyzing sensitive content.
- Anonymize others if requested.
- Avoid psychoanalysis; stick to observable behaviors.
